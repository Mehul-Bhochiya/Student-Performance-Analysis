### 2️⃣ Family Background Influence on Student Performance
- Charts: Motivation, Parental Education, Family Income vs Performance  
- Slicers: Gender, Parental Involvement, Parental Education, Family Income  

### 3️⃣ School Environment & Exam Score
- Charts: Teacher Quality, Resources, Peer Influence, School Type  
- Slicers: Gender, School Type, Study Hours, Resources, Teacher Quality, Peer Influence  

### 4️⃣  Lifestyle & Daily Habits impacts on Scores
- Charts: Sleep, Internet Access, Physical Activity, Learning Disabilities  
- Slicers: Gender, Internet Access, Learning Disabilities, Physical Activity  

### 5️⃣ Multi-Factor Analysis
